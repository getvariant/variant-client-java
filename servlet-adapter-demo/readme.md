# Variant Demo Application
### Release 1.0.0
#### Requires: Java 7 or later, Java Servlet API 2.4 or later, Variant Client 0.7 + Variant Servlet Adapter

[__Documentation__](http://www.getvariant.com/docs/0-7/installation-and-demo/#section-3)

__Variant demo application__ is built with the popular [Pet Clinic webapp](https://github.com/spring-projects/spring-petclinic), available from the Sprinig MVC Web framework. This doesn't mean that your application must also use Spring MVC â€” we're using it for demonstration purposes only, as it provides the opportunity to demonstrate both Variant's [bare Java client](http://getvariant.com/docs/0-7/clients/variant-java-client/#section-2) as well as the [servlet adapter](/servlet-adapter).

1. [Install Variant Software](http://www.getvariant.com/docs/0-7/installation-and-demo/#section-2) and start Variant experiment server.
2. Follow [these instructions](http://www.getvariant.com/docs/0-7/installation-and-demo/#section-4) to deploy this demo application.
